# Flowchart Symbols and Components

Understanding the basic symbols is key to reading and creating flowcharts. While many specialized symbols exist, the following are the most common ones used in practice.

- **Oval (Terminator):**
  - **Represents:** The start or end point of the process.
  - **Text:** "Start", "Begin", "End".

- **Rectangle (Process):**
  - **Represents:** A single step or an action to be performed.
  - **Text:** A short verb-noun phrase (e.g., "Calculate total", "Boil water").

- **Diamond (Decision):**
  - **Represents:** A point where a decision must be made or a question is asked. The outcome (usually "Yes" or "No") determines the next step.
  - **Text:** A question (e.g., "Is water hot?", "Valid credentials?").

- **Parallelogram (Input/Output):**
  - **Represents:** Inputting data or displaying results.
  - **Text:** "Get user input", "Display error message".

- **Arrow (Flow Line):**
  - **Represents:** The direction of flow in the process. It connects the symbols.
  - **Text:** None, but can have labels like "Yes" or "No" originating from a decision diamond.

- **Circle (Connector):**
  - **Represents:** A jump from one part of the flowchart to another, used to avoid messy crossing lines in complex diagrams.
