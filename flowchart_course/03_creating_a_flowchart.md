# How to Create a Flowchart

Creating a flowchart is a logical, step-by-step process.

1.  **Define the Process:** Clearly identify the process you want to diagram. What is the starting point? What is the end goal?

2.  **Brainstorm the Steps:** List all the actions, decisions, and inputs/outputs involved. Don't worry about the order yet, just get all the components down.

3.  **Draft the Flowchart:**
    *   Start with a "Start" terminator symbol.
    *   Begin adding the steps and decisions in their logical sequence.
    *   Use the correct symbol for each step.
    *   Connect the symbols with arrows to show the flow.

4.  **Review and Refine:** Go through the flowchart. Does it accurately represent the process? Is it clear and easy to follow? Ask a colleague to review it for clarity.

## Simple Example: Making a Cup of Tea

Here is a flowchart for the process of making a simple cup of tea.

1.  **Start** (Oval)
2.  `->`
3.  **Boil Water** (Rectangle)
4.  `->`
5.  **Is water boiling?** (Diamond)
    *   **No ->** (Loop back to "Boil Water")
    *   **Yes ->**
6.  **Place tea bag in cup** (Rectangle)
7.  `->`
8.  **Pour boiling water into cup** (Rectangle)
9.  `->`
10. **End** (Oval)
