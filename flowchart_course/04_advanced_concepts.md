# Advanced Flowchart Concepts

Once you are comfortable with the basics, you can start incorporating more advanced concepts to handle complex logic.

## Loops

A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. In a flowchart, this is typically represented by an arrow that loops back to an earlier step, often controlled by a decision diamond.

**Example: A 5-Minute Timer**
A process box might say "Wait 1 minute". A decision diamond after it asks "Have 5 minutes passed?". If "No", the flow line loops back to the "Wait 1 minute" box. If "Yes", the flow continues to the next step.

## Subroutines (Pre-defined Processes)

If a sequence of steps is repeated in multiple places in your flowchart, you can define it once as a subroutine. The symbol for a pre-defined process is a rectangle with double vertical sides.

**Example: Calculating Sales Tax**
Instead of having a series of steps for calculating sales tax multiple times, you could have a single subroutine box labeled "Calculate Sales Tax". You would then create a separate, detailed flowchart for that specific subroutine.

## Types of Flowcharts

- **Process Flowchart:** The most common type, used to document and analyze a process. (This is what we have been focusing on).
- **Data Flowchart:** Shows how data is processed within a system. It emphasizes the data itself, rather than the process logic.
- **System Flowchart:** Shows the flow of data at a high level, often between major system components like files, programs, and hardware.
- **Program Flowchart:** A detailed diagram showing the logic of a specific computer program.
