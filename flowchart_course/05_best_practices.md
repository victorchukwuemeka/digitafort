# Flowchart Best Practices

To ensure your flowcharts are effective and easy to understand, follow these best practices:

- **Consistency:** Use the same symbols consistently throughout your diagram.
- **Clarity:** Keep the text within the symbols clear and concise. Avoid jargon where possible.
- **Flow Direction:** Maintain a consistent flow direction, typically from top-to-bottom and left-to-right.
- **Simplicity:** Break down very complex processes into multiple, smaller flowcharts using connectors or subroutines. Avoid having too many crossing lines.
- **Use Connectors:** For complex flows, use on-page (circle) or off-page connectors to avoid long or crossing flow lines.
- **Define Scope:** Clearly indicate the start and end points of the process. A process should have only one starting point.
- **Review:** Always have someone else review your flowchart to check for clarity and logical errors.
