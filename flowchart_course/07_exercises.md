# Flowchart Exercises

The best way to get good at flowcharting is to practice. Try creating flowcharts for the following processes.

## Exercise 1: Your Morning Routine

Create a flowchart that details your personal routine from the moment your alarm goes off until you leave your home for the day. Include decisions like "Snooze alarm?" and "What to wear?".

## Exercise 2: Is the Number Even or Odd?

Create a flowchart for a process that takes a number as an input and determines if it is even or odd.

**Hint:** The key operation is the modulo operator (`%`). A number is even if `number % 2` equals 0.

## Exercise 3: Simple ATM Withdrawal

Create a flowchart for the process of withdrawing money from an ATM.

**Considerations:**

- Include PIN validation.
- Include checking the account balance.
- What happens if the PIN is incorrect?
- What happens if the requested amount is greater than the available balance?
- Don't forget to dispense the cash and return the card.
