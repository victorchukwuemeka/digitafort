# Module 1: Introduction to Computer Science

## Lesson 1: What is Computer Science?

**What is Computer Science?**

Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.

Principal areas of study within computer science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human-computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics, and theory of computing.

**Misconceptions about Computer Science**

A common misconception is that computer science is all about programming. While programming is an essential tool for a computer scientist, it is only a means to an end. Computer scientists use programming to create solutions to problems, but the core of the discipline is about problem-solving, logical thinking, and understanding the capabilities and limitations of computation.

To put it another way, a computer scientist is like an architect who designs a building. The architect needs to understand the principles of engineering and physics to create a sound design, but they don't necessarily need to lay the bricks themselves. Similarly, a computer scientist needs to understand the principles of computation to design a solution, but the implementation (programming) is just one part of the process.

**Why Study Computer Science?**

In today's world, technology is ubiquitous. Understanding the principles of computer science can empower you to:

*   **Solve complex problems:** Break down large problems into smaller, manageable pieces and develop logical solutions.
*   **Innovate and create:** Develop new technologies and applications that can change the world.
*   **Understand the digital world:** Gain a deeper understanding of the technology that shapes our lives.
*   **Pursue a rewarding career:** Computer science skills are in high demand across a wide range of industries.

In the next lesson, we will explore the history of computing to understand how we got to where we are today.
