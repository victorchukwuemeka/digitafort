# Module 1: Introduction to Computer Science

## Lesson 3: What is an Algorithm?

The concept of an algorithm is one of the most fundamental ideas in computer science. An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.

**Characteristics of an Algorithm**

A well-defined algorithm has the following characteristics:

*   **Input:** An algorithm has zero or more inputs, which are quantities that are given to it initially before it begins.
*   **Output:** An algorithm has one or more outputs, which are quantities that have a specified relation to the inputs.
*   **Finiteness:** An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.
*   **Definiteness:** Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case.
*   **Effectiveness:** Each step must be simple enough that it can be carried out in a finite amount of time by a person with pencil and paper.

**An Example of an Algorithm**

Let's consider a simple example of an algorithm: finding the largest number in a list of numbers.

**Problem:** Given a list of positive numbers, find the largest number in the list.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Assume the first number in the list is the largest. Let's call it `largest_number`.
2.  Go through the rest of the numbers in the list one by one.
3.  For each number, compare it with `largest_number`.
4.  If the current number is greater than `largest_number`, then update `largest_number` to be the current number.
5.  After going through all the numbers, `largest_number` will hold the largest number in the list.

**Why are Algorithms Important?**

Algorithms are the building blocks of computer programs. Every task that a computer performs is the result of an algorithm. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to find the most efficient solutions to problems.

The study of algorithms is a major field within computer science. It involves designing new algorithms, analyzing their efficiency, and understanding their limitations.

This concludes the first module of our course. In the next module, we will dive into the fundamentals of programming using the Python language. We will learn how to write our own algorithms and translate them into code.
