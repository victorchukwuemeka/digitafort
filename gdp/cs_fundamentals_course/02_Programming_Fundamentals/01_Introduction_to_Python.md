# Module 2: Programming Fundamentals (Python)

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Python

**What is Python?**

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

**Why Python?**

Python is a great choice for beginners for several reasons:

*   **Easy to learn and read:** Python's syntax is simple and clean, which makes it easy to learn and read.
*   **Versatile:** Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more.
*   **Large community and ecosystem:** Python has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are plenty of resources available to help you learn and solve problems.
*   **"Batteries included":** Python comes with a large standard library that provides modules for common tasks, so you don't have to write everything from scratch.

**Setting up your Python Environment**

Before you can start writing Python code, you need to set up your development environment.

1.  **Install Python:** You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2.  **Verify your installation:** To verify that Python has been installed correctly, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    This should print the version of Python that you have installed.

3.  **Install a code editor:** You will also need a code editor to write your Python code. Some popular choices include:

    *   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    *   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
    *   [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    *   [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

**Your First Python Program**

Let's write our first Python program. Open your code editor, create a new file called `hello.py`, and type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

To run this program, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type the following command:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see the following output:

```
Hello, world!
```

Congratulations! You have written and executed your first Python program.

In the next lesson, we will learn about variables and data types in Python.
