# Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. This is a key step in algorithmic thinking, as it allows you to focus on solving one part of the problem at a time.

When you're decomposing a problem, it's important to identify the different components of the problem and how they relate to each other. You can then create a separate algorithm for each subproblem.

Once you've solved all of the subproblems, you can combine the solutions to solve the original problem.
