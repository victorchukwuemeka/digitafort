# Pattern Recognition

Pattern recognition is the process of identifying similarities or patterns in data. This is another key step in algorithmic thinking, as it can help you to simplify a problem and make it easier to solve.

When you're looking for patterns, it's important to consider the different ways that data can be represented. You can then use this information to develop a more efficient algorithm.

Once you've identified a pattern, you can use it to make predictions about future data.
