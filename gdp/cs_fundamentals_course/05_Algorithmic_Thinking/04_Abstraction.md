# Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding the details of a problem in order to focus on the bigger picture. This is a key step in algorithmic thinking, as it allows you to create a more general-purpose algorithm that can be used to solve a variety of problems.

When you're abstracting a problem, it's important to identify the essential features of the problem and how they relate to each other. You can then create a model of the problem that captures these features.

Once you've created a model, you can use it to develop an algorithm that solves the problem.
