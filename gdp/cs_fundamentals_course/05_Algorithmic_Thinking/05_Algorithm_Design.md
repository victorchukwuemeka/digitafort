# Algorithm Design

Algorithm design is the process of creating a step-by-step set of instructions for solving a problem. This is the final step in algorithmic thinking, and it's where you'll bring together all of the skills you've learned in this section.

When you're designing an algorithm, it's important to be clear, concise, and unambiguous. You should also consider the efficiency of your algorithm and how it will perform on different types of data.

Once you've designed an algorithm, you can test it to make sure that it's correct and that it meets all of the requirements of the problem.
